To perform form validation using JavaScript with HTML, you can use the following steps:

1. Add the input fields that you want to validate. These could include name inputs, email inputs, and contact input, among others.
2. Add a obblur & onclick  event. 
3. Add a JavaScript function that will be used to perform the form validation. This function should be triggered when the submit button is clicked.
4. Within the validation function, use JavaScript to check the values of the input fields. If any of the fields are invalid (e.g. an email field is blank or an input is    not in the correct format), display an error message to the user and prevent the form from being submitted.
